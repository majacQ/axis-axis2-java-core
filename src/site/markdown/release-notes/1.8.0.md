Apache Axis2 1.8.0 Release Note
-------------------------------

*   The minimum required Java version for Axis2 has been changed to Java 7.

*   The Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x based HTTP transport has been deprecated.
    If you wish to continue using this transport, add `axis2-transport-http-hc3`
    to your project.

*   The HTTPClient 4.x based transport has been upgraded to use the APIs supported
    by the latest HTTPClient version.

*   To improve dependency management, the data binding JARs have been split to
    separate the code required at build time from the code required at runtime:
    *   `axis2-jibx` has been split into `axis2-jibx` and `axis2-jibx-codegen`.
    *   `axis2-xmlbeans` has been split into `axis2-xmlbeans` and
        `axis2-xmlbeans-codegen`.
    *   `axis2-jaxbri` has been renamed to `axis2-jaxbri` (The JAXB-RI data
        binding doesn't require any additional classes at runtime).
    *   There are no changes for ADB because the code was already split in
        previous Axis2 versions.
